## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd stock-analysis-app

# Run setup script
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

# Start development servers
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup
```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install frontend dependencies  
cd ../frontend
yarn install

# Go back to root
cd ..
```

### Start backend (super easy)

If you only want to start the backend quickly (no prior setup knowledge required), open PowerShell and run these commands exactly as shown.

1) Change to the backend folder:

```powershell
cd "D:\\Trade AI\\Stock-analyzer-Backend"
```

2) Start the server (one simple command):

```powershell
python -m uvicorn server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001 #Backend First
```

3) Check the server is running (health check):

```powershell
curl http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/health
# Expected output: {"status":"active","message":"Stock Analysis API is running"}
```

Notes for absolute beginners:
- You do not need to install anything else to run the server if Python is already installed.
- If you see an error about missing packages, run these two commands before step (2):

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
. .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

That's it — the backend will be reachable at http://127.0.0.1:8001

### Start frontend (super easy)

If you only need to run the frontend locally, open PowerShell and run these commands exactly as shown.

1) Change to the frontend folder:

```powershell
cd "D:\\Trade AI\\Stock-analyzer-Frontend\\frontend"
```

2) (Optional) If you want to set the backend URL for the frontend locally, create a `.env.development` file in the `frontend` folder with the following content (or run the exact command below to set it for the current shell):

```powershell
# Create .env.development with the backend URL
@'
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8001
'@ > .env.development

# Or set for current session only:
#$env:REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL = 'http://localhost:8001'
```

3) Start the frontend dev server (one simple command):

```powershell
npm start
```

4) Open the app in your browser:

http://localhost:3000

Notes for absolute beginners:
- If port 3000 is already in use you will be prompted to run the dev server on another port — accept or stop the other process.
- If you see errors about missing packages, run these commands first from the `frontend` folder:

```powershell
npm install
```

That's it — the frontend will be reachable at http://localhost:3000 (or the alternate port chosen).


## 🔧 Configuration

### 1. Backend Environment Variables

Create `backend/.env` file and add only the API keys your deployment requires (examples):
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
CHART_IMG_API_KEY=your_chartimg_api_key_here  # Optional for legacy support
```

### 2. Frontend Environment Variables

Create `frontend/.env` file:
```env
# For localhost development
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8001

# For production (if using custom backend)
# REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
```

## 🖥️ Development

### Start Both Services
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Start Services Individually
```bash
# Backend only (runs on http://localhost:8001)
npm run backend

# Frontend only (runs on http://localhost:3000)  
npm run frontend
```

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

## 🌐 Deployment

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "HTTP error! status: 502"
- **Cause**: Backend service not running or misconfigured
- **Solution**: Check if backend is running on correct port, verify environment variables

#### "🔄 The AI service is currently busy"
- **Cause**: Gemini API rate limits or temporary unavailability
- **Solution**: Wait a few moments and try again, check API key validity

#### "📁 The uploaded image is too large"
- **Cause**: Image file exceeds 10MB limit
- **Solution**: Compress image or use a smaller file

#### Frontend not connecting to backend
- **Cause**: Incorrect `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL`
- **Solution**: Verify environment variable matches backend URL
